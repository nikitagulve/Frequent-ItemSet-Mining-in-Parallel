# Frequent-ItemSet-Mining-in-Parallel
The idea of this project is to build a Music Recommendation System to recommend genres to users. It uses Frequent ItemSet Mining algorithm,  Apriori, to do the same. It makes use of MapReduce framework to achieve Parallel Data Processing. The goal is to find frequently occuring genre sets in Yahoo! Music Dataset. Yahoo! Music Data Set represents a snapshot of the Yahoo Music community's preferences for various songs. The dataset contains over 717 million ratings of 136 thousand songs given by 1.8 million users of Yahoo! Music services. The data was collected between 2002 and 2006. Each song in the data set is accompanied by artist, album, and genre attributes. The mapping from genres id's to genres, as well as the genre hierarchy, is given.
